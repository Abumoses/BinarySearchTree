# Binary Search Tree (BST) Insertion in C

This project demonstrates how to implement **insertion** into a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** using the C programming language. A Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree where each node has a key greater than all the keys in its left subtree and smaller than all the keys in its right subtree.

## What is a Binary Search Tree?

A **Binary Search Tree** is a special type of binary tree that maintains a sorted structure, making operations like insertion, deletion, and search efficient:
- Left child < Parent node < Right child

**Time Complexities:**
- Best/Average Case: O(log n)
- Worst Case (unbalanced): O(n)

## Features

- Insert elements into a BST
- Display the tree using in-order traversal (sorted order)
- Dynamic memory allocation using `malloc`
- Simple, clear, and modular code

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: C
- **Compiler**: GCC or any standard C compiler
- **Libraries**: `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`
